# Virtual RobotX (VRX)
This repository is the home to the source code and software documentation for the VRX simulation environment, which supports simulation of unmanned surface vehicles in marine environments.
* Designed in coordination with RobotX organizers, this project provides arenas and tasks similar to those featured in past and future RobotX competitions, as well as a description of the WAM-V platform.
* For RobotX competitors this simulation environment is intended as a first step toward developing tools prototyping solutions in advance of physical on-water testing.
* We also welcome users with simulation needs beyond RobotX. As we continue to improve the environment, we hope to offer support to a wide range of potential applications.

## Introduction
Research for autonomous navigation in the field of wheeled mobile robotics dates back to 1950â€™s and has grown quite strong in the past decade with advancement of computation power, availability of low-cost sensors and most importantly the large open-source community, whereas research in maritime robotics is younger comparatively mostly because of the challenges and large number of parameters to deal with when interacting with water. In this report I demonstrate autonomous navigation using a USV in an unknown (no pre-built map) water lake simulated environment. This small project is for the final selection round for a remote internship at the Autonomous Engineers Private Limited (AEPL), India.

## Obstacle Avoidance and Navigation using move_base
1. Create workspace and setup repo
```bash
mkdir -p ~/vrx_ws/src
cd ~/vrx_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/YashKSahu/vrx
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
```
2. Compile and Run
```bash
cd ~/vrx_ws
catkin_make
source  ~/vrx_ws/devel/setup.bash
roslaunch vrx_gazebo vrx.launch
```
3. Bringup
- This launch file containes the basic nodes for the USV.
  - robot state publisher
  - joint state publisher
  - tf
  - localization
  - odom filter node
  - odom tf
  - point cloud to laser scan
```bash
roslaunch vrx_gazebo bringup.launch
```
4. Thrust to Twist
- Most ROS packages are written w.r.t wheeled robots, and hence the parameters are also in accordance to it. A USV doesnt have wheels but thrusters instead to push it in water current. VRX has provided a thrust2twist node to convert thrust commands to equivalent geometry twist commands.
```bash
roslaunch vrx_gazebo usb_keydrive.launch
```
5. move_base Obstacle Avoidance
- I found three different ways of performing autonomous navigation
  - With a pre-built known map
    - gmapping for building map and then amcl and move_base to navigate
  - Building and saving map simulataneously while autonomously navigating and exploring envrionment
    - slam and move_base to map and navigate simultaneously 
    - or RTAB Map and move_base
  - Without a known map, mapless navigation
    - just pure move_base navigation, obstacles are avoided on exploration but map and obstacle information is lost globally

```bash
roslaunch vrx_gazebo move_base.launch
```
6. Give a 2d navigation goal from rviz

7. Lawn Mower Navigation Script
This script can work for both with and without obstacle cases, as only move_base is running in backround to send navigation goals to controllers.
```bash
rosrun vrx_gazebo navigation_goal.cpp
```
![](images/lawn.jpeg)

- currently stuck on this error due to low cpu power 
```bash
Map update loop missed its desired rate of 4.0000Hz... the loop actually took 1.4040 seconds.
Aborting because a valid plan could not be found. Even after executing all recovery behaviors
```
